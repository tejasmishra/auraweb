Currently using Foundation 6.2.0

### What is auraweb?
auraweb is a WordPress theme built with Foundation 6, for Aura Interactive giving you all the power and flexibility you need to build complex, mobile friendly websites without having to start from scratch.

Starting its humble life as a fork of the popular theme Bones, auraweb is now the foundation of thousands of websites across the globe.

### What comes with auraweb?
auraweb comes pre-baked with all of the great features that are found in the Foundation framework – simply put, if it works in Foundation, it will work in auraweb. The theme also includes:

- Foundation Navigation Options
- Motion-UI
- Grid archive templates
- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support
- And much, much more!

### What tools do I need to use auraweb?
You can use whatever you want – seriously. While the Sass version comes with Bower and Gulp support out of the box, you aren’t required to use those by any means. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It’s completely up to you how you decide to build you theme – auraweb won’t get in the way of your workflow.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run npm install
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working
